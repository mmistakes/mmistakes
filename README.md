# Oh hey ‚Äî I'm Michael Rose

Just another bearded designer, developer, and occassional illustrator living and working in Buffalo, New York. 

I‚Äôm into [drawing portraits of strangers](https://mademistakes.com/paperfaces/) on a iPad Pro, eating üçø popcorn and chicken wings, watching dust collect on [my vinyl record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing single-player console exclusives.

When I‚Äôm not drawing or releasing open source [Jekyll themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/), I work as a web designer and content administrator for a leading global provider of laboratory products. On any given day I‚Äôm massaging text and assets in and out of enterprise content management systems you‚Äôve probably never heard, building web pages for marketing campaigns, creating user-interfaces, and working with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to flesh out pattern libraries, components, templates, and static prototypes across an array of digital properties.

I‚Äôm also the father of üë≠ twin girls and married to a [subscription box addicted vegan](https://2littlerosebuds.com/).
