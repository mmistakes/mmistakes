# Oh hey — I'm Michael Rose

Just another boring, bearded, tattooed, designer, front-end developer, and occasional illustrator who works and resides in Buffalo New York.

I’m into [drawing portraits of strangers](https://mademistakes.com/paperfaces/) on an iPad Pro, making popcorn, eating chicken wings, watching dust collect on [my vinyl record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing single-player console exclusives on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 5.
